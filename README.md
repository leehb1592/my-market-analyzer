# my-market-analyzer
A playground for technical analysis of stock market data

Scrape stock data from the web into .csv files using the built-in macro enabled Excel workbook then use the project to display, compare, and manipulate the data. Ultimately the goal of this was to enable custom algorithm development, but that's still mostly lacking.

ABOUT:
The premise for this was simple: I wanted to re-familiarize myself with some of the concepts I learned in my machine learning and pattern recognition courses in university. To do that I needed a large and readily available dataset. I figured financial data, and specifically stock prices, would fit the bill. I soon found that the data I was looking for was not as readily available as I thought; at least not in a way that would make it easy to use for what I wanted (unless I was willing to pay). So I built this project. Currently includes working implementations of the k-NN and fuzzy c-means algorithms.
