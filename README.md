A playground for technical analysis of stock market data

DISCLAIMER:
The actual functionality of this thing is extremely limited. I know next to nothing about trading stocks or any other financial vehicles. Don't get your hopes up if you're looking for a real good, free tool. Also don't expect regular updates. This is just something I do in my spare time.

ABOUT:
The premise for this was simple: I wanted to re-familiarize myself with some of the concepts I learned in my machine learning and pattern recognition courses in university. To do that I needed a large and readily available dataset. I figured financial data, and specifically stock prices, would fit the bill. I soon found that the data I was looking for was not as readily available as I thought; at least not in a way that would make it easy to use for what I wanted (unless I was willing to pay). So I built this project. 

Scrape stock data from the web into .csv files using the built-in Excel program then use the project to display, compare, and manipulate the data. Ultimately the goal of this was to enable custom algorithm development, but that's still mostly lacking. Do with this what you will.
